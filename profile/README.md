# GLOFICA

**The Sovereign & Institutional Financial AI-Backbone**

**GLOFICA** is **a Post-Quantum DLT-based ecosystem** for the next generation of global and institutional finance.

It achieves this through four core technical pillars:

---

### 1. Quantum-Safe Cryptography
It moves beyond legacy ECDSA, implementing **Dilithium3** for digital signatures and **Kyber768** for Key Encapsulation (KEM), ensuring that sovereign financial assets remain secure even against future quantum computer attacks.

### 2. Chimera DLT Architecture
A hybrid fusion engine for global scale. It uses the **FlashDAG-Narwhal++** mempool, [**Mysticeti**](https://github.com/MystenLabs/mysticeti) consensus and the [**XOOK Merkle Tree**](https://github.com/Praexor/xook), capable of sustaining over **10,000 TPS** with sub-eight-hundred-millisecond finality.

### 3. Sovereign AI Cortex (Neural Orchestrator)
It doesn't just transfer value; it manages complex monetary policies through **zkML reasoning engines (DeepSeek R1)** and specialized opcodes in its Cognitive VM, specifically designed for **Digital Settlement Assets** and institutional automation.

### 4. Global Interoperability & Compliance
Native support for **ISO 20022** messaging and the **Ley Genius** innovation framework. GLOFICA bridges the gap between central banks, tier-1 institutions, and neobanks through automated compliance and 1:1 settlement finality.
